In an underground longwall coal mine, coal is mined in ``panels'', as
shown in Figure~\ref{lw_mining_graphic.fig}.  These panels are typically 3--4\,m in
height, 150--400\,m in width and 1000--4000\,m long.  Coal is
extracted from one end, moving towards the other end.  As mining
progresses, a void is created behind the mining
machinery where the coal used to be.  The rock material above this
void --- the ``overburden'' -- is not strong enough to support itself,
so it collapses downwards.  The resulting partial void and collapsed
material is called the ``goaf'' (or ``gob'').

\end{figure}

There are many geotechnical aspects that are of interest in this
process, but this Example concentrates on the following.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The vertical displacement of the ground surface due to the
  longwall mining.  This is called the ``subsidence''.  This obviously
  has effects on buildings and other man-made structures like roads,
  but it can also change surface water pathways, affect vegetation,
  and cause surface-water ponding, which all have effects on the local
  ecology.
\item\label{item2} The vertical deformation within the overburden.
\item The patterns of fracture in the overburden.  Together with
  Item~\ref{item2}, this can have effects on operational aspects of
  longwall mining, such as the load patterns on the ``chocks'' that
  support the roof of the goaf next to the mining machinery.  It also
  strongly effects the flow of fluids in the porous rocks that make up
  the overburden.  If the fracturing and deformation is extensive then
  fluids can easily move through the rock.  This can result in mines
  flooding with water, or causing excessive drawdown of groundwater
  aquifers which can effect other users of groundwater (such as
  irrigators for farming) or can effect the rates of groundwater
  baseflow to surrounding river systems which may effect local and
  not-so-local ecosystems.  The deformation and fracture of the
  overburden can also lead to aquifer mixing, where an aquifer
  consisting of ``dirty'' water (with high salinity, for example)
  pollutes a nearby aquifer of clean water.  The deformation and
  fracture can also lead to large releases of methane gas from
  overlying (and underlying) coal seams.  This methane can then flow
  through the highly permeable fractured rock system to the
  atmosphere, resulting in large greenhouse gas emissions.  Or it can
  flow to the mine workings which is extremely hazardous in terms of
  mine fires and explosions.
\end{enumerate}

This Example does not seek to build a realistic model of a specific
mine.  Instead, it explains how the TensorMechanics module can be used
to build such a model, by exploring a very simplified and contrived 2D toy
model.  Of particular interest are the input parameters used and how they
effect the results.

\chapter{The model setup}
\label{m.d.chap}

A 2D model representing a transverse section of overburden above a
longwall panel is studied in this Example.  It is shown in
Figure~\ref{model_setup.fig}.  The longwall panel is 300\,m wide and the height of
extraction is 3\,m.  The transverse section describes only half
(150\,m) of the panel and it assumed that the situation is symmetric
about the panel's mid line.  The panel is 400\,m deep ($0\leq z\leq 400$).  The model
measures 450\,m in the $y$ direction ($0\leq y\leq 450$).  The model
is actually 1\,m in the $x$ direction but this is unimportant in the
subsequent analysis.

\begin{figure}[htb]

  dimensions are in metres.  The geometry is described in the text.}
\label{model_setup.fig}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The overburden is assumed homogeneous (but
anisotropic).  Boundary conditions are described below.  The
overburden's density is 2500\,kg.m$^{-3}$.


\chapter{Elastic simulations}
\label{elastic.chap}

The simulation results quoted in this section are derived using the
MOOSE input file {\tt cosserat\_elastic.i}.

\section{Motivation}

Setting the strata's yield strengths very high means that the
deformation is purely elastic.  Of course this is unphysical, but it
is interesting from a theoretical viewpoint.  An example deformation
is shown in Figure~\ref{cosserat_elastic_fig}.

The boundary conditions in this Chapter are: roller on
$y_{\mathrm{min}}$ and $y_{\mathrm{max}}$; no rotation around the $x$
axis on $y_{\mathrm{min}}$; fixed on $z_{\mathrm{min}}$
where there is no excavation; stress-free on the top and the roof of
the excavation.  Therefore, the overburden is free to move vertically
under the action of gravity, and this models half of an excavation
that is 300\,m wide.

  displacement on the top surface of the model; and ``extensometer''
  which is vertical displacement along a vertical line that runs down
  the left-hand-side of the mode.}
\label{cosserat_elastic_fig}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\section{Beam theory}

The beam deformation may be compared with simple beam theory by
thinking of the overburden as a beam of thickness $T=400$\,m and
length $L=300$\,m, clamped at its ends and subject to its own self
load.  The maximum deflection of such a beam is
\begin{equation}
  u_{z}^{\mathrm{max}} = \frac{\rho TW g L^{4}}{384 EI} \ .
\end{equation}
Here $\rho=2500$\,kg.m$^{-3}$ is the beam's density, $W=10$\,m is its
width, $g=10$\,m.s$^{-2}$ is gravitational acceleration, $E=8$\,GPa is
the Young's modulus of the beam, $I$ its momenta of intertia:
\begin{equation}
  I = \int_{-T/2}^{T/2}{\mathrm d}z \int_{-W/2}^{W/2}{\mathrm d}x
  z^{2} = (2W/3)(T/2)^3 \ .
\end{equation}
Substituting this into the formula for maximum deflection yield
\begin{equation}
  u_{z}^{\mathrm{max}} = \frac{\rho g L^{4}}{32 ET^2} \approx
  800/T^{2} \ ,
  \label{eqn.elastic.delfection}
\end{equation}
(measured in units of m).
This formula will never give the precise displacement since various
assumptions (such as the pinned end conditions, and neglecting all but
the lowest-order terms) have been made in its
development.

\section{Comparison with beam theory --- non-Cosserat case}

Before
exploring the effects of introducing Cosserat mechanics, it is useful
to quantify the accuracy of Eqn~(\ref{eqn.elastic.delfection}) for
various $T$, using standard (non-Cosserat) elasticity (and modifying
the model described in Chapter~\ref{m.d.chap} to have an overburden of
thickness $T$ instead of just $T=400$\,m).    To do this,
the input file {\tt cosserat\_elastic.i} is used, but the layer
thickness, and Cosserat moduli are set very large.  The mesh used is
different in each case, but is set dense enough so that mesh
dependencies are small.

\begin{table}[htb]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
  T & Eqn~(\ref{eqn.elastic.delfection}) & MOOSE (non-Cosserat) & N \\
  \hline
  400 & 0.005 & 0.19 & 1000 \\
  100 & 0.08 & 0.33 & 1000 \\
  40 & 0.5 & 0.89 & 4000 \\
  10 & 8 & 8.7 & 20000\\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Comparison of the approximate analytic deflection of
  Eqn~(\ref{eqn.elastic.delfection}) with MOOSE's non-Cosserat
  result.  MOOSE's deflection is measured at the roof of the coal seam
  ($z=0$).  The last column, $N$, indicates the number of elements in
  the mesh before reasonable mesh-independence is obtained  ($N=1000$ was the
  minimum number tried).}
\label{elastic.deform.standard}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The results are tabulated in Table~\ref{elastic.deform.standard}.
Evidently, Eqn~(\ref{eqn.elastic.delfection}) under-predicts the
displacement for large $T$.  This is due to the extra freedom allowed
by the model compared with the pinned ends used by the theoretical
development, as well as higher-order terms that are obviously present
in such a thick beam.  Moreover, the MOOSE displacement is always a
function of $z$ (the vertical direction) as is obvious from
Figure~\ref{cosserat_elastic_fig}.

\section{Comparison with beam theory --- Cosserat case}

In many locations where coal seams are present, the overburden is
highly stratified: it consists of layers of rock that have been
deposited over time.  Conceptually the rock looks like a ``layer
cake'' of fairly uniform layers of rock separated by thin and weak
horizontal ``joints''.  Therefore, modelling the rock mass as an
isotropic body is not very accurate.  A better approach is to model it
as a layered material, and this is accomplished by MOOSE's layered
Cosserat elasticity.

Layered Cosserat elasticity allows simulation of a layered material
without having to mesh each individual layer.  Setting the Cosserat
joint normal stiffness large and the joint shear stiffness small
models a layered material in which the layers behave independently.
This is described fully in the documentation for the Cosserat test
suite in MOOSE.  Similar results to
Table~\ref{elastic.deform.standard} may therefore be obtained by
keeping $T=400$\,m, but varying the Cosserat-layer thickness.

The results are shown in Table~\ref{elastic.deform.cosserat}.  It is
clear that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item less elements are needed to obtain reasonable convergence
($N=1000$ was the smallest number of elements used in each set of
  simulations) but this is offset by the increased number of
  degrees-of-freedom (1 in this case, and 2 in the general 3D case);
\item the deformation in the Cosserat case is larger than the standard
  case (because there is more freedom)
\end{enumerate}

\begin{table}[htb]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
  $T_{\mathrm{Cosserat}}$  & Eqn~(\ref{eqn.elastic.delfection}) &
  MOOSE (Cosserat) & N \\
  \hline
  400 & 0.005 & 0.31 & 1000 \\
  100 & 0.08 & 0.67 & 1000 \\
  40 & 0.5 & 1.85 & 4000 \\
  10 & 8 & 14.1 & 9000 \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Comparison of the approximate analytic deflection of
  Eqn~(\ref{eqn.elastic.delfection}) using $T=T_{\mathrm{Cosserat}}$
  with MOOSE's layered Cosserat result with different Cosserat-layer
  thicknesses, $T_{\mathrm{Cosserat}}$.  This may be compared with
  Table~\ref{elastic.deform.standard}.}
\label{elastic.deform.cosserat}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\section{The deformation in the Cosserat case with a variety of Cosserat parameters}

In reality, the Cosserat joints do not have zero shear stiffness.
Table~\ref{elastic.deform.cosserat.shear} quantifies the maximum
vertical displacement for a variety of physically-realistic joint
shear stiffnesses and Cosserat layer thicknesses.

Comparing Tables~\ref{elastic.deform.standard},
\ref{elastic.deform.cosserat} and~\ref{elastic.deform.cosserat.shear},
it is clear that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item for large Cosserat joint stiffness (compared with $E=8$\,GPa)
  the deflection is identical to the non-Cosserat case (as is
  expected);
\item for small Cosserat joint stiffness, the deflection approaches
  the limit of independent layers enumerated in
  Table~\ref{elastic.deform.cosserat};
\item for some intermediate values, the result is only a function of
  $T_{\mathrm{Cosserat}}h_{\mathrm{shear}}$ (as is expected from
  Cosserat theory).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{table}[htb]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
  $T_{\mathrm{Cosserat}}$  & $k_{\mathrm{shear}}$ (GPa.m$^{-1}$) &
  $u_{z}^{\mathrm{max}}$ & $N$ \\

\chapter{Weak-plane plasticity}

\section{Introduction}
In this chapter, the overburden is modelled using weak-plane
plasticity in conjunction with Cosserat mechanics.  The MOOSE input
file used to generate the following results is {\tt
  cosserat\_wp\_only.i}.  The weak plane
normal is assumed to be vertical (in the $z$ direction.  The parameters
used are list in Table~\ref{wp.params.tab}.

\begin{table}[htb]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Young's modulus & 8\,GPa \\
Poisson's ratio & 0.25 \\
Cosserat layer thickness & 1\,m \\
Cosserat joint shear stiffness & 1\,GPa.m$^{-1}$ \\
Cosserat joint normal stiffness & large \\
Weak-plane cohesion & 0.1\,MPa \\
Weak-plane friction angle & 20\,deg \\
Weak-plane dilation angle & 10\,deg \\
Weak-plane tensile strength & 0.1\,MPa \\
Weak-plane compressive strength & 100\,MPa (softening)
\end{tabular}
\caption{Parameters used in the model with weak-plane plasticity.
  Softening for the compressive strength is used in some simulations
  --- see text.}
\label{wp.params.tab}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The mesh is kept fixed (at $N=1000$) in the following simulations, in
contrast to Chapter~\ref{elastic.chap}.  This is rather standard practice in
finite-element simulations of underground material.  Usually the mesh
is chosen to be fine enough so that the resolution is adequate in the
region of interest, and then the mesh is fixed.  This is
motivated by practicalities: it is usually computationally impractical
to perform many simulations with gradually finer mesh to determine the
continuum limit; and the input parameters (Young's modulus, strengths,
etc) are so poorly constrained by observation\footnote{For instance,
  hydraulic permeabilities are usually only constrained to within a
  couple of orders of magnitude, and mechanical properties to within a
  factor of 5.}  that such a study is rather pointless anyway.  The
approach that is usually taken is to fix the mesh and vary the input
parameters so the results (subsidence, etc) match observation.

\section{An unconstrained roof, and constraining boundary conditions}

The elastic parameters in Table~\ref{wp.params.tab} match those used
to generate Figure~\ref{cosserat_elastic_fig}.  Adding the weak-plane
plasticity produces dramatically higher deformations, as shown in
Figure~\ref{wp.no.floow}.  Such high displacements are not possible
because the floor of the excavation constrains
$u_{z}^{\mathrm{max}}\geq -3$\,m.  In fact, the floor strata ``heave''
--- they move slightly upwards --- so usually the maximum downwards
displacement might be between 2.5\,m and 2.9\,m in the case at hand.
I have found MOOSE's constraints to exhibit poor convergence in the
case at hand, therefore, a prescribed boundary condition on the roof
of the excavation is used in this Example.

\begin{figure}[p]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cc}
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\includegraphics[width=8cm]{wp_only_no_floor_disp.pdf}}
  \\
\includegraphics[width=6cm]{wp_only_no_floor_shear.pdf} &

\end{tabular}
\caption{Deformation and plastic strain in the weak-plane model with
  no constraint on the vertical deformation of the overburden.  Top:
  vertical displacement.  Middle: shear and tensile plastic strain.
  Bottom: subsidence and extensomenter displacement.}
\label{wp.no.floow}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The prescribed boundary condition takes one of two forms:
\begin{eqnarray}
u_{z} & = & \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
u_{z}^{\mathrm{max}} \max\left( \min\left( \left(
\frac{t}{t_{\mathrm{end}}}(y_{\mathrm{max}} - y_{\mathrm{min}}) +
y_{\mathrm{min}} - y \right) / d_{\mathrm{closure}}, 1 \right),
0\right) & \mbox{ or} \\
u_{z}^{\mathrm{max}} \frac{t}{t_{\mathrm{end}}} \max\left( \min\left(
(y_{\mathrm{max}} - y)/d_{\mathrm{closure}}, 1 \right), 0\right)
\end{array}
\right.
\end{eqnarray}
The following parameters are chosen: $u_{z}^{\mathrm{max}} = -3$\,m,
$y_{\mathrm{min}} = 0$, $y_{\mathrm{max}}=150$\,m and
$d_{\mathrm{closure}}=15$\,m.  These two forms correspond physically
to the following.
\begin{enumerate}
\item ``Sideways excavation'', where the coal is excavated from
  $y_{\mathrm{min}}$ to $y_{\mathrm{max}}$ during the time $0\leq
  t\leq t_{\mathrm{max}}$.  At time $t$, the excavation has reached $y_{t}
  = y_{\mathrm{min}} + t(y_{\mathrm{max}} -
    y_{\mathrm{min}})/t_{\mathrm{end}}$.  For $y$ less than this
    amount, the roof is allowed to displace a maximum
  of $u^{z}_{\mathrm{max}}$.  For $y$ greater than this amount, the
  roof has zero displacement.  There is a small region between
  $y_{t}-d_{\mathrm{closure}}$ and $y_{t}$ where the roof displacement
  is between zero and $u_{z}^{\mathrm{max}}$, but for
  $y<y_{t}-d_{\mathrm{closure}}$, $u = u_{z}^{\mathrm{max}}$.
\item ``Downwards excavation''.  The roof is gradually lowered.  At
  $t=0$ the displacement is zero, while at $t=t_{\mathrm{end}}$ the
  displacement is equal to $u_{z}^{\mathrm{max}}$ for most of the
  roof.  There is a small region between $y_{\mathrm{max}}$ and
  $y_{\mathrm{max}} - d_{\mathrm{closure}}$ where the displacement
  varies between zero and $u_{z}^{\mathrm{max}}$.
\end{enumerate}
A quasi-static solution is sought at each timestep, and no dynamics is
used, so ``time'' has no real physical meaning, except that it allows
the roof to be gradually lowered.

For a single timestep, both ``sideways'' and ``downwards'' excavation
produce the same result.  This is shown in Figure~\ref{wp.one_step}.

\label{wp.one_step}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\section{Multiple excavation steps}

However, the results are markedly different when using multiple
steps.  Figure~\ref{wp.10_step} shows the displacement when using 10
steps.  In the ``sideways'' excavation, only the bottom row of
elements is actually deforming!  They have very large plastic shear
and tensile strain.  This is not physically realistic.  However, in
the ``downwards'' excavation, there is very little dilation of the
elements in the near roof, which is also probably not realistic.  This
is because no substantial shear failure is activated by this type of
boundary condition.

\caption{Deformation the weak-plane model when using either the
  ``sideways'' or ``downwards'' movement of the excavation roof.}
\label{wp.10_step}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\section{Softening the compressive strength}

Consider now an alternate plastic model with a softening weak-plane
compressive strength.  At zero (or negative) plastic tensile strain it
is large (100\,MPa), but a plastic tensile strain equal to unity it
has softened all the way down to 1\,MPa.  Physically this corresponds
to a rock then when pulled apart in tension (such as the roof being
pulled downwards) it can then not withstand much compressive load,
until it is recompacted somewhat.  The results are shown in Figure~\ref{wp.10_sideways_soften_soften}.

\begin{figure}[p]
